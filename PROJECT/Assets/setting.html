				<h2>Westeros and Essos</h2>
				<p>The show and books are set in a fictional world, known as the "Known World", with two main continents Westeros and Essos. The plot is set around the medieval era where slavery, monarchies and war are all present. The world also contains many mythical creatures such as white walkers, dragons etc.
				Westeros is where the majority of the plot takes place. Westeros is made up of 7 kingdoms which are ruled from the King on the Iron Throne, in the city of King's Landing. The conflict within the show is centred around who will control the Iron throne. Essos is a larger continent seperated from Westeros by the Narrow Sea. It is made up of 9 free cities, which s ironic as slavery is the most prosperous trade within this region. 
				The setting of Game of Thrones is amazingly detailed which can be seen from the detailed map on the right.

			<h1>Familes of Westeros</h1>
			<p>Westeros is made up of the Seven Kingdoms, which are ruled by the Great Houses. There are seven Great Houses at the start of the show each ruling a respective area. One of these houses rules the Seven Kingdom from the Iron throne, usually the house of the King. The iron throne is also helped rule by the house of the King's wife (the Queen). The seven Great Houses are; House Stark, House Lannister, House Tyrell, House Tully, House Martell, House Baratheon and House Arryn. There are other large families or houses within Westeros but they do not control one of the Seven Kingdoms. These include House Frey, House Greyjoy, House Bolton, and House Targaryen. House Targaryen used to rule all of Westeros until they were defeated in "Roberts Rebellion" a war that led to the structure of the houses as they are at the start of the show.
