				<h1>Characters in Game of Thrones</h1>
				<p>Game of Thrones is filled with interesting and exciting characters throughout. They range from the meanest, most horrid people you would ever meet to a character that you just cant help root and cheer for. For the majority of the show we follow three main plot points and from that we meet a variety of different people. In the first season you will meet the entire Stark family, the savages of the east(Dorthraki) and all of the people involved in the throne. Below is a brief description of some of the characters that you will meet in the first season.</p>
