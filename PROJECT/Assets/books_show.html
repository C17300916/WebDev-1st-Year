			<h1>Main Differences</h1>
			<p>Although the show is based on the novel series, there are some differences between the two. This is due to the show being incapabable of including every small plot point included in the books. Some of these differences include missing characters, small side plots and some characters appearences. The show did a great job at adapting the majorty of the books but some fans of the books complain about some major things left out. Overall the books and the show are different but both outstanding in their own right!</p>
