			<h1>When is the show back?</h1>
			<p>Season 8 of Game of Thrones is set to premiere in 2018/2019 depending on filmimg. Filming for this season began on October 2017. Season 8 will be shorter than previous seasons, consisting of six episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes. There also news that five potential "successor shows", more likely prequels, are certainly possible which has excited the whole GoT community!</p>

			<h1>When the next book is released?</h1>
			<p>Fans of the books have been frusterated with the length of time they have been waiting for the next book in the series, "Winds of Winter". It was estimated to be released in 2017 but it is still being worked on and is unlikely to be released until 2018!</p>
